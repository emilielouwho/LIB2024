<h2> About The Sewing Guide </h2>
<p> Where there were about 10 social media references to creators, fabric stores, and pattern makers, is now filled with copious pages about as much as I can offer about sewing and textile art. Sewing has become an increasingly inspiring medium in which I have found a want and yearn to create art again. Whether with a machine or by hand, making my own clothes and learning to rebuild my wardrobe as ethically and sustainably as possible has allowed me to learn more about consumption and the slow process of making. This ensures that I can also make what I want (the way I want).</p> <p> Making your own clothing doesn’t have to be hard or challenging or too expensive. In a world where making is undervalued and over consumed, fabric and tools have become increasingly more expensive and, in turn, difficult to acquire. So, what better way to find what you need than by the reference of a broke 20-something?! 
Clothes-making for me has been a way to learn more about a topic that I have always loved, and in my wildest dreams, thought of doing. Little me would have loved to move to Paris, and work in a design house on the top floor of a 19th century stone building; however, time and circumstance keep this a fantasy. But, I think making my own clothing may be a little more fun… </p> <p>
Don’t let anyone tell you that making clothing isn’t an art. It takes skill, thought, creativity and time just like building a piece of art does. You may be excited and overzealous and make lots of mistakes along the way. But remember that making clothing by hand, at home, is not for a quick turnaround. We are making with purpose, and our intention is to learn, and strengthen our skills along the way. </p>
<p> This Guide, as much as this website, is also a living document that continues to change and evolve as I learn and source new information and tools to help those who are new or want to engage in an ever-evolving world of fibre arts.
